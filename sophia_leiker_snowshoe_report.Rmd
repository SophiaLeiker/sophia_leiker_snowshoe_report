## 1. Introduction

SOPHIA RETURN TO THIS AT THE END
you will explore the counts and sizes of juvenile snowshoe hares recorded from 1998 - 2012.

## 2. Data and Analysis 

[Bonanza Creek LTER](https://www.lter.uaf.edu/research) is part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network that is through the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The data being used for this analysis is avalible from Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess and their study [Snowshoe hare physical data in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest: 1999-Present](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.55.22) where they "conducted capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares at 5 locales in the Tanana valley, from Tok in the east to Clear in the west from 1999 to 2002." In their study they found that Snowshoe hare densities were highest in 1999 ( =6.36 ha-1, SE=0.63) and declined thereafter. They were unable to detect declines in apparent survival during declining densities in studied study populations. They stated that the movement distances did not vary temporally and persistence of individuals through declining densities may be associated positively with body condition at the peak.

## 3. Annual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts 

- Annual juvenile hare trap counts were counted during each year of the study
- Grouping and summarizing to assess the counts each year

```{r}
# Converting the date to mdy format and then mutating to pull out the year 
hare_counts <- hares %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))

#Grouping by year and then adding up the total counts per year 
hare_table <- hare_counts %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total = n())
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_table, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_col(color = "white", fill = "cyan4") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Juvenile Hare Trappings", title = "Count of Total Juvenile Hare Trappings Per Year", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +
  theme_grey() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1999:2012)
```

**Figure 2.** Count of total juvenile hare trappings from 1999 to 2012

```{r hare analysis}
hare_table_stats <- hare_table %>% 
  summarise(hare_mean = round(mean(total),1),
            hare_median = median(total),
            hare_sd = round(sd(total),1),
            hare_max = max(total),
            hare_min = min(total)
            )
```



**Analysis**: The minimum count of juvenile hare trapping (for those years where juvenile hares were actually trapped therefore values over 0), is `r hare_table_stats$hare_min`, the maximum count of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_max`. The mean of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_mean`, the median is `r hare_table_stats$hare_median`. The standard deviation of the count of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_sd`. In general there was a high number of juvenile hares trapped in 1999 and 2000, but there is a trend of decreasing hare traps moving towards 2012, with spikes in 2005 and 2008. Moving forward in order to standardize the analysis of juvenile hare populations I would recommend ensuring that for each year that traps are put out for the study, they are left out the same number of days, checked at the same frequency, and placed in the same locations. By doing this, one can eliminate factors such as the habitat preferences of the hares and make sure that there is consistency across years.

## 4. Juvenile Hare Weights

- Comparing juvenile hare weights by sex and site (grid)
- 

```{r comparing weights by sex and site}

hare_weights <- hare_counts %>% 
  group_by(sex, grid) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == "f" ~ "Female",
    sex == "m" ~ "Male", 
    is.na(sex) == TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(grid = case_when(
    grid == "bonrip" ~ "Bonanza Riparian",
    grid == "bonmat" ~ "Bonanza Mature",
    grid == "bonbs" ~ "Mature Lowland Black Spruce Stand"
  ))
  #summarize(weight_mean = mean(weight))
```

```{r plotting}
ggplot(data = hare_weights, aes(x= weight, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~grid + sex) +
  labs(x = "Hare Weight (g)", y = "Count of Hare Weights", title = "Distribution of Hare Weights by Site and Sex", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Hare Sex")) + 
  theme_grey()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_weights, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.4, outlier.color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~grid) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("deeppink3","blue","green")) + 
  labs(x = "Hare Sex", y = "Hare Weight (g)", title = "Distribution of Hare Weights by Site and Sex", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +

  stat_summary(fun=mean, 
               geom="point", 
               shape=15, 
               size=3, 
               color="black", 
               fill="black") 

```


ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(color = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("goldenrod2","cyan4","coral")) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.2, outlier.color = NA) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, 
               geom="point", 
               shape=20, 
               size=4, 
               color="black", 
               fill="black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "\nPenguin species",
       y = "Flipper length (mm)\n")
