## 1. Introduction

This report explores counts, sizes and physical relationships of juvenile showshoe hares as recorded from 1998 to 2012. It provides an exploratory overview and assessment of juvenile hare's in relation to their weight, site trapped and hind foot length. The 3 sites assessed are from 1) Bonanza Riparian, a flood zone along the Tanana River 2) Bonanza Mature, consisted of stands of mature white spruce, paper birch, and alder 3) a site located in a mature lowland black spruce stand. Specifically, this report assesses the change in annual juvenile hare trap counts starting in 1998, analyzes the distribution of hare weights by site and sex, compares juvenile Weight between males and females, and finally assesses how hind foot length (mm) is related to juvenile hare weight.

## 2. Data and Analysis 

[Bonanza Creek LTER](https://www.lter.uaf.edu/research) is part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network that is through the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The data being used for this analysis is avalible from Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess and their study [Snowshoe hare physical data in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest: 1999-Present](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-bnz.55.22) where they "conducted capture-recapture studies of snowshoe hares at 5 locales in the Tanana valley, from Tok in the east to Clear in the west from 1999 to 2002." In their study they found that Snowshoe hare densities were highest in 1999 ( =6.36 ha-1, SE=0.63) and declined thereafter. They were unable to detect declines in apparent survival during declining densities in studied study populations. They stated that the movement distances did not vary temporally and persistence of individuals through declining densities may be associated positively with body condition at the peak.

## 3. Annual Juvenile Hare Trap Counts 

Annual juvenile hare trap counts were counted during each year of the study. This assessment groups by year to assess the annual juvenile hare trap counts.

```{r}
# Converting the date to mdy format and then mutating to pull out the year 
hare_counts <- hares %>% 
  filter(age == "j") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))

#Grouping by year and then adding up the total counts per year 
hare_table <- hare_counts %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total = n())
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_table, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_col(color = "white", fill = "cyan4") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Juvenile Hare Trappings", title = "Count of Total Juvenile Hare Trappings Per Year", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +
  theme_grey() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1999:2012) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

**Figure 2.** Count of total juvenile hare trappings from 1999 to 2012

```{r hare analysis}
hare_table_stats <- hare_table %>% 
  summarise(hare_mean = round(mean(total),1),
            hare_median = median(total),
            hare_sd = round(sd(total),1),
            hare_max = max(total),
            hare_min = min(total)
            )
```



**Analysis**: The minimum count of juvenile hare trapping (for those years where juvenile hares were actually trapped therefore values over 0), is `r hare_table_stats$hare_min`, the maximum count of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_max`. The mean of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_mean`, the median is `r hare_table_stats$hare_median`. The standard deviation of the count of juvenile hare trapping is `r hare_table_stats$hare_sd`. In general there was a high number of juvenile hares trapped in 1999 and 2000, but there is a trend of decreasing hare traps moving towards 2012, with spikes in 2005 and 2008. Moving forward in order to standardize the analysis of juvenile hare populations I would recommend ensuring that for each year that traps are put out for the study, they are left out the same number of days, checked at the same frequency, and placed in the same locations. By doing this, one can eliminate factors such as the habitat preferences of the hares and make sure that there is consistency across years.

## 4. Juvenile Hare Weights


```{r comparing weights by sex and site}

hare_weights <- hare_counts %>% 
  group_by(sex, grid) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(
    sex == "f" ~ "Female",
    sex == "m" ~ "Male", 
    is.na(sex) == TRUE ~ "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(grid = case_when(
    grid == "bonrip" ~ "Bonanza Riparian",
    grid == "bonmat" ~ "Bonanza Mature",
    grid == "bonbs" ~ "Black Spruce"
  ))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = hare_weights, aes(x = sex, y = weight)) +
  geom_beeswarm(cex = 2, aes(color = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.4, outlier.color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~grid) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("deeppink3","blue","green")) + 
  labs(x = "Hare Sex", y = "Hare Weight (g)", title = "Distribution of Hare Weights by Site and Sex", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Hare Sex")) +
  stat_summary(fun=mean, 
               geom="point", 
               shape=15, 
               size=3, 
               color="black", 
               fill="black") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```


**Figure 3.** Relationship between hare sex and hare weight (g) for the three sample sites. Points indicate individual hare measurements with red points indicating female hares, blue points indicating male hares and green points indicating an unknown hare sex. The box plots in black indicate the 25th and 75th percentile values of the data spread, the black line indicates the median value, the black square indicates the mean value for each juvenile hare sex category.


```{r hare weight stats}
hare_females_riparian <- hare_weights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female", grid == "Bonanza Riparian") %>% 
  pull(weight) %>% 
  na.omit()
female_riparian <- round(mean(hare_females_riparian),1)

hare_males_riparian <- hare_weights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male", grid == "Bonanza Riparian") %>% 
  pull(weight) %>% 
  na.omit()
male_riparian <- round(mean(hare_males_riparian), 1)

hare_males_spruce <- hare_weights %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male", grid == "Black Spruce") %>% 
  pull(weight) %>% 
  na.omit()
male_spruce <- round(mean(hare_males_spruce), 1)

```


**Analysis** Bonanza Riparian has most observations as illustrated by more points in the beeswarm plot. On average, the male juvenile hares had higher weights than the female juvenile hares across the three study sites. This can be seen in the Bonanza Riparian zone where the average weight of females is `r female_riparian` (g), and the average weight of males is `r male_riparian` (g). In general, there were fewer samples collected for the "unknown" juvenile hare sex category so statistics related to these samples may not be the most reflective of the actual population spread. The spread of Male observations was much higher in the Bonanza Mature cite and Bonanza Riparian in relation to the Black Spruce cite, this can be seen by the box plots having a larger interquartile range in these two cites for the male observations. On average, the observations for both male and female weights are higher in the black spruce sample site compared to the Bonanza Mature cite and Bonanza Riparian cites, with the highest average seen for the males in the Black Spruce cite with a value of `r male_spruce` (g).

```

**Analysis** On average juvenile male hares have higher weights than juvenile female hares. The male mean is (`r round(male_mean,1)` (g) $\pm$ with a standard deviation of `r round(male_sd, 1)`. The female mean is `r round(female_mean,1)` $\pm$ with a standard deviation of `r round(female_sd, 1)` (g.) The absolute difference in means is `r round(male_mean, 1) - round(female_mean, 1)` (g) which equates to a `r round((male_mean - female_mean)/((male_mean + female_mean)/2)*100, 2)` % difference). On average, the juvenile male hares have higher weight values than juvenile female hares, the difference in means is significant (as indicated by the p-value from the (Welch Two Sample t-test is t(`r round(hare_test_tidy$parameter,2)` = `r round(hare_test_tidy$statistic,2)` < 0.001, p-value `r round(hare_test_tidy$p.value,3)`), and the effect size is small (Cohen's *d* = `r round(hare_effsize$estimate,2)`).

## 6. Relationship Between Juvenile Weight & Hindfoot Length

```{r}

  scale_color_manual(values = c("deeppink3","blue","green"), 
                     name = "Hare Sex") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Hindfoot Length (mm)", y = "Weight (g)", title = "Relationship between Juvenile Hare Weight & Hind Foot Length", subtitle = "Data from: Kielland, K., F.S. Chapin, R.W. Ruess, and Bonanza Creek LTER") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +

```

```{r linear regression}
# Do linear regression
hare_lm <- lm(hindft ~ weight, data = hare_weights)

# Get tidy versions of the model output to call later on in text
hare_lm_tidy <- tidy(hare_lm)
hare_lm_glance <- glance(hare_lm)

# See model diagnostics:
 #plot(hare_lm)

# Get Pearson's r correlation
hare_cor <- cor.test(hare_weights$hindft, hare_weights$weight)

# Tidy version of correlation output:
hare_cor_tidy <- tidy(hare_cor)
```


**Figure 4** Relationship between Hindfoot Length (mm) and Hare Weight (g) for juvenile hares. Points indicate individual hare measurements with colors indicating the hare sex associated with each. $\beta$~1~ = `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g/mm, p < 0.001, R^2^ = `r round(hare_lm_glance$r.squared,2)`, Pearson's *r* = `r round(hare_cor_tidy$estimate,2)`).


**Analysis** The relationship between penguin juvenile hare hindfoot length and juvenile hare weight appears relatively linear, with a visually tighter line for the female data (Figure 4). Simple linear regression shows that hindfoot length weakly predicts juvenile hare weight (p < 0.001, with an R^2 value = `r round(hare_lm_glance$r.squared,2)`), with an average slope of $\beta$ = `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g/mm. In other words one could say that for each milimeter increase in hindfoot length, we expect an average increase in body mass of `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g). Hindfoot length and body mass are are positively, significantly, and moderately positively correlated. This is seen by looking at Pearson's *r* = `r round(hare_cor_tidy$estimate,2)`, with a p value p < 0.001). Diagnostic plots reveal normally distributed and heteroscedastic residuals. This concerns me as the residuals are concentrated around the lower values of leverage in the linear model of hindfeet ~ weight. 


***

## 7. Summary

Exploratory data analysis reveals the following initial findings: 

- On average, male juvenile hares have higher weights than female juvenile hares
- Of the three study sites, the Black spurce site on average had larger juvenile hares as indicated by larger average weights for both male and females
- Hindfoot length appears weakly linearly related with juvenile hare weight, using linear regression the relationship is significant, though the residuals illustrate a heteroscedastic pattern, thus further data analysis should take place to explain this phenomenon
- The linear regression relationship indicates that the expected average increase in juvenile weight (g) with a 1 mm increase in hindfoot length is `r round(hare_lm_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` g/mm.
- Moving forward there should be further assessment to analyze if there are varying relationships between hindfoot length and weight across male hares versus female hares 
- It would be interesting to test linear regressions and/or trends in weight as changing across time (are the hares increasing or decreasing weight since 1999)
